# Colwell Benefits Consulting - Landing Page Implementation

## Overview
This documentation outlines the implementation of the new Colwell Benefits Consulting landing page, replacing the original ROI Calculator landing page. The design follows the provided screenshots, focusing on employee benefits consultancy services for UK SMEs.

## Implementation Details

### Page Structure
The landing page follows a modern, section-based design with the following components:
1. Hero Section - Main headline and introduction
2. Benefits Section - Four key benefits of the service
3. Services Section - Detailed description of services offered
4. Pricing Section - Three pricing tiers
5. Testimonials Section - Client testimonials
6. Contact Form Section - Consultation booking form

### Key Files Created
- `src/components/landing/*.tsx` - Individual landing page section components
  - `Hero.tsx` - Main hero section
  - `BenefitsSection.tsx` - Four benefits grid
  - `ServicesSection.tsx` - Services with image and bullet points
  - `PricingSection.tsx` - Three-column pricing table
  - `TestimonialsSection.tsx` - Client testimonials
  - `ContactFormSection.tsx` - Consultation booking form
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Updated to use new landing page components
- `src/app/consultation/page.tsx` - Consultation page
- `src/app/the-problem/page.tsx` - The Problem page
- `src/app/our-solution/page.tsx` - Our Solution page
- `src/app/pricing/page.tsx` - Pricing page
- `src/app/testimonials/page.tsx` - Testimonials page

### Design Considerations
- **Navigation**: Utilizes the existing WizardShell component for navigation
- **Responsive Design**: All components are fully responsive with mobile and desktop layouts
- **Accessibility**: Uses semantic HTML with proper labeling
- **UK English**: All text content written in UK English
- **Branding**: Uses blue as the primary color with an emphasis on clarity and professionalism

### Notes
- Placeholder images are used with fallbacks to placeholder images if actual images aren't present
- Client logos in the testimonials section use gray placeholders
- The contact form is functional on the frontend but requires backend implementation
- Routes have been created for all main navigation items

## Next Steps
- Add actual images for the services section and testimonial photos
- Implement form submission functionality
- Complete the content for placeholder pages (The Problem, Our Solution)
- Configure proper navigation links in the TopNavigation component

## Technical Implementation
The landing page uses the existing Next.js framework and component structure. We've kept the WizardShell component to maintain consistency with the rest of the application but replaced its content with our new landing page sections.

All components use Tailwind CSS for styling, matching the screenshots provided.
