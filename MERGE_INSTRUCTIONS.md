# Instructions for Merging the Optimized Industry News Page

To properly implement the optimized Industry News page, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a new full page.tsx file

Create a single `page.tsx` file by combining the content from:
1. `page.tsx` (Part 1) - from the beginning to around line 400
2. `page-continued.tsx` (Part 2) - from where Part 1 left off to the end

Since both files are too large to include in a single message due to token limits, I've provided them in two parts. You'll need to join them manually.

## Step 2: Verify file size

Ensure the combined file is complete. The file should:
- Start with `'use client';`
- End with the closing `}` of the `IndustryNews` function
- Include all necessary imports, interfaces, and components

## Step 3: Test the implementation

1. Restart your development server after implementing all the changes
2. Navigate to the Industry News page to verify the improvements
3. Check the browser console for any errors

The page should now:
- Load much faster, especially on repeat visits
- Show a nice loading skeleton during initial load
- Allow manual refreshing of the content
