# Hugging Face API Updates Summary

I've updated all the Hugging Face API endpoints in your codebase to use the new format as of 2025. Here are the changes I made:

## 1. Updated API Endpoints in route.ts

Changed the API URL format from:
```
https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/{model_name}
```

To the new router format:
```
https://router.huggingface.co/{model_name}
```

Updated the following functions in `src\app\api\enhanced-rss\route.ts`:
- `summarizeText` function (line ~316)
- `extractTopics` function (line ~342)
- `createMasterSummary` function (line ~400)

## 2. Updated API Endpoints in rss-worker.js

Made similar updates in the worker file `src\workers\rss-worker.js`:
- `analyzeSentiment` function (line ~173)
- `summarizeText` function (line ~223)

## 3. Left the Local Implementations Intact

I noticed that you already have a local implementation for sentiment analysis in `route.ts`. I left this in place since it's a good fallback if the Hugging Face API continues to have issues.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server** to apply the changes.

2. **Test the API connections** by navigating to the Industry News page.

3. **Check the console logs** to see if the API calls succeed with the new URL format.

4. If you still encounter "Not Found" errors, you might need to:
   - Try alternative models
   - Create dedicated Inference Endpoints on Hugging Face
   - Use the @huggingface/inference client library

Let me know if you need any further adjustments to make this work!
