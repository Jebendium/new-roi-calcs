# Vercel Deployment Checklist - MediaStack Integration

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts Resolved
- ✅ Updated `lucide-react` to version `^0.400.0` (React 19 compatible)
- ✅ Created `.npmrc` file with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
- ✅ Clean `package.json` without conflicting overrides
- ✅ Build now compiles successfully

### 2. Syntax Errors Fixed
- ✅ Corrected malformed object structure in `update-news/route.ts`
- ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces and function definitions
- ✅ All imports and exports working correctly

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Files Ready for Deployment:
- ✅ `src/app/api/update-news/route.ts` - Main MediaStack integration
- ✅ `src/app/api/enhanced-rss/route.ts` - Updated to serve from Vercel KV
- ✅ `vercel.json` - Cron job configuration
- ✅ `.npmrc` - npm configuration for dependency resolution
- ✅ `package.json` - Clean dependencies
- ✅ Updated news page with MediaStack attribution

### Environment Variables for Vercel:
You'll need to set these in your Vercel dashboard:

```
MEDIASTACK_API_KEY=7acff57b316c792f424c3d47850e15a5
CRON_SECRET=mediastack_cron_2025_secure_key
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-497e8039ae2b433e84eb84057cb9b457
```

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "MediaStack integration - dependency fixes for Vercel deployment"
git push origin master
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add the three environment variables listed above

### 3. Deploy
- Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to master
- OR trigger manual deployment from Vercel dashboard

### 4. Verify Deployment
1. Check build logs for success
2. Visit your deployed site
3. Check `/resources/news` page
4. Manually trigger cron job: `yoursite.com/api/update-news?cron_secret=mediastack_cron_2025_secure_key`

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Monitoring

### 1. Check Cron Job Execution
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Functions → Cron Jobs
- Should show daily execution at 5:00 AM UTC
- Monitor for successful runs

### 2. Test API Endpoints
- `/api/enhanced-rss` - Should serve cached data from KV
- `/api/update-news?cron_secret=...` - Manual trigger (should work)

### 3. Check News Page
- Visit `/resources/news`
- Should show MediaStack attribution
- Check "Last updated" timestamp
- Verify articles are loading

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If Build Still Fails:
1. Clear build cache in Vercel settings
2. Check all environment variables are set
3. Review build logs for specific errors

### If Cron Job Doesn't Run:
1. Verify `vercel.json` is in project root
2. Check environment variables are set
3. Try manual trigger to test endpoint

### If No Articles Show:
1. Check if cron job has run successfully
2. Verify MediaStack API key is valid
3. Check Vercel KV is properly configured
4. Try manual trigger to populate data

## 📊 Expected Performance

### MediaStack Limits:
- Free tier: 1,000 requests/month
- 100 articles/day (25 per category × 4 categories)
- Should be well within limits

### Vercel KV:
- Stores processed articles daily
- Fast retrieval for frontend
- No real-time API calls from frontend

## 🎉 Success Indicators

✅ Build completes without errors  
✅ Environment variables set in Vercel  
✅ Cron job shows in Vercel dashboard  
✅ `/resources/news` page loads with articles  
✅ MediaStack attribution visible  
✅ "Last updated" timestamp shows recent data
