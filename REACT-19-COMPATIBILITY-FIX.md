# React 19 Compatibility Fixes for ROI Calculator Project

## Issue Identified

After analyzing your codebase, I've found that you're encountering dependency conflicts when trying to install packages with React 19. The specific error relates to `lucide-react@0.316.0` which has a peer dependency on React versions 16-18, but your project is using React 19.

I also found that the DeepSeek API test is failing because the `dotenv` package is missing.

## Solution Files Created

I've created the following files to fix these issues:

1. **install-dotenv.bat**
   - Installs the dotenv package using the --legacy-peer-deps flag
   - This will fix the DeepSeek API test error

2. **install-openai-fixed.js**
   - Updated version of your OpenAI installation script
   - Uses the --legacy-peer-deps flag to bypass peer dependency checks

3. **install-openai-fixed.bat**
   - Batch file to run the fixed installation script

4. **update-openai-script.bat**
   - Creates the fixed installation script

## How to Use

1. First, install the dotenv package:
   ```
   install-dotenv.bat
   ```

2. Then, you can run the DeepSeek API test:
   ```
   run-deepseek-test.bat
   ```

3. To install OpenAI with the legacy-peer-deps flag:
   ```
   install-openai-fixed.bat
   ```

## What This Fixes

This approach allows you to:
1. Install packages that have peer dependencies on older React versions
2. Run your DeepSeek API tests successfully
3. Continue using React 19 without downgrading

## Future Package Installations

For any future package installations, use the --legacy-peer-deps flag:

```
npm install [package-name] --legacy-peer-deps
```

This will prevent similar peer dependency conflicts with React 19.
