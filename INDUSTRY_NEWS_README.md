# Industry News Module Optimization and Refactoring

## Overview

The Industry News section has been completely refactored to improve both performance and code maintainability. This was done by:

1. Breaking up the monolithic page.tsx file into smaller, reusable components
2. Implementing client-side data caching for faster loading
3. Adding timeouts and fallbacks throughout the API chain
4. Improving error handling and user experience

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Enhanced Caching**
   - Server-side cache duration extended from 1 hour to 6 hours
   - Added client-side localStorage caching with 6-hour expiry
   - Reduced feed update frequency from 30 minutes to 4 hours

2. **Timeout and Fallbacks**
   - Added explicit timeouts throughout the API chain (5-8 seconds)
   - Implemented local fallbacks for AI services when they take too long
   - Set maximum time budget (30 seconds) for the entire feed process

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Reduced articles processed per feed from 5 to 3
   - Better batch processing with improved parallelization
   - Progressive loading: show cached data first, update in background

### Code Structure Improvements

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Split the monolithic page.tsx into reusable components
   - Created dedicated hooks for data fetching logic
   - Separated utility functions and type definitions

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Professional loading skeletons during initial load
   - Better error states with helpful messages
   - Manual refresh capability without full page reload

```

## Usage

No changes are required to use the Industry News section. It works the same as before but loads much faster, especially for returning visitors.

### First Visit
- Shows loading skeletons while fetching data
- Stores data in localStorage cache

### Subsequent Visits
- Immediately displays cached data
- Fetches fresh data in the background
- Updates cache with new data when available

## Configuration

The cache duration and article limits can be adjusted:

- Client-side cache: 6 hours (configurable in useNewsData.ts)
- Server-side cache: 6 hours (configurable in cache.ts)
- Articles per feed: 3 (configurable in incremental-updater.ts)
- Articles per category: 3 (configurable in page.tsx) 

## Note on Backend Optimization

These frontend changes complement the backend optimizations made to:

- Enhanced caching in `cache.ts`
- API timeouts in `api-services.ts`
- Better feed processing in `feed-fetcher.ts`
- Improved article handling in `feed-utils.ts`
- Time budgeting in `incremental-updater.ts`
