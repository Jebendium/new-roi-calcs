# Industry News Page Refactoring Guide

## Overview

The Industry News page has been completely refactored to improve both performance and code maintainability. The main goals were:

1. Break up the monolithic page.tsx file into smaller, reusable components
2. Implement client-side data caching for faster loading
3. Add timeouts and fallbacks throughout the API chain 
4. Improve error handling and user experience

## Project Structure

The refactored code follows a modular architecture:

```
src/app/resources/industry-news/
├── components/                # UI components
│   ├── ArticleCard.tsx       # Individual article card
│   ├── FilterControls.tsx    # Filter and search controls
│   ├── LoadingSkeleton.tsx   # Loading state skeleton
│   ├── NoResultsMessage.tsx  # Empty state message
│   ├── Pagination.tsx        # Page navigation controls
│   ├── TrendingTopics.tsx    # Trending topics section
│   └── index.ts              # Component exports
├── hooks/                    # Custom React hooks
│   └── useNewsData.ts        # Data fetching and caching hook
├── utils/                    # Utility functions
│   └── formatDate.ts         # Date formatting utility
├── types.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces
└── page.tsx                  # Main page component (now much smaller)
```

## Key Improvements

### Component Separation
- Each UI element is now its own component, making the code more maintainable
- The page.tsx file now focuses on layout and orchestration rather than implementation details

### Data Management
- Created a custom `useNewsData` hook to handle data fetching, caching, and error states
- Implemented localStorage caching to reduce load times on repeat visits
- Added proper loading states and skeletons for better UX

### Performance
- Timeouts to prevent API calls from hanging indefinitely
- Reduced the number of articles processed per feed
- Improved error handling to prevent cascade failures

## Technical Details

### The `useNewsData` Hook
This custom hook handles all data operations:
- Fetches data from the `/api/enhanced-rss` endpoint
- Implements local storage caching with a 6-hour expiry 
- Provides loading states, error handling, and refresh functionality

### Data Flow
1. Page loads and immediately tries to load from localStorage cache
2. If cache exists and is less than 6 hours old, it's used immediately
3. Fresh data is always fetched in the background to update the cache
4. If no cache exists, a loading skeleton is shown until data arrives

### Error Handling
- API calls now have 30-second timeouts to prevent indefinite loading
- Errors are displayed gracefully with specific error messages
- The system falls back to cached data when available, even if fresh data fails to load

## Implementation Notes

This refactoring assumes the backend optimizations are also in place:
- Enhanced caching in `cache.ts`
- API timeouts in `api-services.ts`
- Better feed processing in `feed-fetcher.ts`
- Improved article handling in `feed-utils.ts`
- Time budgeting in `incremental-updater.ts`

Together, these changes should significantly improve the user experience by making the Industry News page load faster and be more responsive.
