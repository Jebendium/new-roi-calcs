# Fixing Hugging Face API Issues: Implementation Guide

Based on our investigation, the issue with your sentiment analysis and trending topics functionality is that the Hugging Face API endpoint format has changed since your code was written. As of 2025, Hugging Face has shifted to a new API structure that requires using the router endpoint instead of direct access to inference models.

## What Changed

1. The Hugging Face API now uses a standard router endpoint format:
   ```
   https://router.huggingface.co/{model_name}
   ```
   instead of the previous:
   ```
   https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/{model_name}
   ```

2. The API authentication structure is the same, but models need to be registered or accessed differently.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Update the analyzeSentiment function in route.ts**
   - Open `src\app\api\enhanced-rss\route.ts`
   - Find the `analyzeSentiment` function (around line 213)
   - Replace it with the code from `updated_sentiment_function.txt`

2. **Update the extractTopics function in route.ts**
   - In the same file, find the `extractTopics` function (around line 340)
   - Replace it with the code from `updated_topic_extraction_function.txt`

3. **Update the Worker analyzeSentiment function**
   - Open `src\workers\rss-worker.js`
   - Find the `analyzeSentiment` function (around line 173)
   - Replace it with the code from `updated_worker_sentiment_function.txt`

4. **Test the Implementation**
   - After making these changes, restart your development server
   - Navigate to the Industry News page
   - Monitor the console for debugging information
   - Check if sentiment analysis and trending topics are working

## Additional Considerations

1. **Verify Hugging Face Token**
   - Ensure your HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN in the .env file is valid
   - Check it has the right permissions for inference API access

2. **Model Availability**
   - If the updated endpoint still returns "Not Found" errors, you may need to:
     - Create a dedicated Inference Endpoint on Hugging Face for these models
     - Use alternative models that are available through the router

3. **Consider Rate Limits**
   - The new API may have different rate limits that could affect performance

## Fallback Options

If the Hugging Face API continues to be unavailable, you have two options:

1. **Deploy Private Inference Endpoints** - You can deploy your own Hugging Face Inference Endpoints with the specific models you need.

2. **Implement Local Analysis** - As a last resort, you can use the local sentiment and topic extraction implementation we prepared earlier.
