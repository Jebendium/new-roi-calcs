# Industry News Feature Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Industry News feature to address timeout issues, improve content quality, and enhance the user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Feed Processing Improvements

- **Increased Timeout Limits**:
  - `MAX_UPDATE_TIME` in incremental-updater.ts increased from 2 minutes to 6 minutes
  - Individual feed processing timeout increased from 10s to 15s
  - Batch processing timeout increased from 15s to 30s

- **Increased Priority Feeds**:
  - Number of feeds processed per batch increased from 4 to 8
  - This allows for more content to be fetched in a single update

- **Articles Per Feed**:
  - Increased from 2 to 4 items per feed for display
  - Increased from 5 to 8 items fetched per feed for processing

### 2. AI Summary Quality Improvements

- **Enhanced Master Summary**:
  - Updated prompt to request 2-4 paragraphs instead of 3-5 sentences
  - Increased token limit from 300 to 600 tokens
  - Number of articles used in summary generation increased from 5 to 10
  - Specified UK English spelling and terminology in prompts

- **Trending Topics Enhancement**:
  - Made trending topics clickable and interactive
  - Added search functionality tied to topic clicks
  - Increased number of articles analyzed for topic extraction from 10 to 15
  - Added local topic extraction fallback for each article

### 3. Category Organization

- **Category Structure**:
  - Reorganized feed categories to match "HR News", "Payroll News", and "Employee Benefits News"
  - Added additional feeds to each category for more comprehensive coverage

- **Display Improvements**:
  - Increased minimum articles per category from 3 to 4
  - Increased articles per page from 10 to 12
  - Added feedback when a topic or search term is active

### 4. Next.js Configuration Updates

- Fixed configuration warning by moving `serverComponentsExternalPackages` to `serverExternalPackages`
- Updated the configuration to comply with Next.js 15 standards

## Additional Features

- **Local Topic Extraction**:
  - Added local topic extraction for each article to ensure topics are available even when API calls time out
  - This enables more robust topic-based filtering

- **Fallback Mechanisms**:
  - Added robust fallback mechanisms for all API operations
  - If a summary or sentiment analysis times out, local alternatives are used
  - This ensures the feature remains functional even under high load

- **Sequential Processing**:
  - Added sequential processing for larger batches to prevent overwhelming the server
  - This helps stabilize performance and reduce timeouts

## Performance Considerations

- The feature now balances between processing more content while maintaining reasonable performance
- Cache settings have been optimized to reduce unnecessary reprocessing
- Error handling has been improved to prevent cascading failures

## Next Steps

- Monitor timeout occurrences after these changes
- Consider more advanced batching strategies if needed
- Explore more efficient topic extraction algorithms
