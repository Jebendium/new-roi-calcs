# ROI Calculator Suite UI/UX Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to standardize and improve the ROI Calculator Suite's user interface and user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Consistent Input Layouts
- Converted the table-based benefit configuration in Employer NI Savings Calculator to a card-based layout
- Standardized card designs across all calculators
- Added clear labels with units (£, %, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Information Support
- Added standardized InfoTooltip components next to fields requiring explanation
- Created consistent InfoBox components for important contextual information
- Standardized the display of helper text and tooltips

### 3. Improved Results Presentation
- Standardized the hierarchy of results display:
  1. Key headline metrics at the top
  2. Visual charts with clear labels
  3. Supporting detailed breakdowns
  4. Interpretive text explaining what the results mean
- Fixed the "undefined%" display bug in pension contribution results

### 4. UK English Standardization
- Created a UK English style guide to ensure consistent spelling across all text
- Updated terms to use UK variants (e.g., "organisation" not "organization")
- Standardized currency formatting with £ symbol and proper thousand separators

### 5. Visual Consistency
- Created shared UI components for consistent styling
- Improved whitespace, padding, and visual hierarchy
- Enhanced typography to create clearer hierarchy between titles, labels, and values

## File Structure

The improvements maintain a modular code structure with no "god files" (no files over 500 lines):

- `src/components/ui/` - Shared UI components like InfoTooltip, InfoBox, ResultHighlight
- `src/components/icons/` - SVG icons used throughout the application
- `src/calculators/` - Calculator-specific components

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. Always use the shared UI components for consistency
2. Follow the UK English style guide for all user-facing text
3. Use the card-based approach for all benefit configuration sections
4. Follow the standard results hierarchy pattern for all calculators
5. Ensure all fields have appropriate explanation via tooltips or helper text
