## Environment Variable Setup

For your convenience, a `.env.local.example` file has been created showing how to properly set up the Hugging Face API tokens. To use this:

1. Rename the file to `.env.local` or copy its contents to your existing `.env.local` file
2. Add your Hugging Face API token to both environment variables:
   ```
   HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="your_token_here"
   ```

## Getting a Hugging Face API Token

1. Go to https://huggingface.co/ and create an account if you don't already have one
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
3. Generate a new token with "Read" access
4. Copy the token and add it to your environment variables as described above

## Alternative Models

If you experience issues with specific models, the code has been prepared to work with these alternative models:

- For sentiment analysis: `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`
- For topic extraction: `yanekyuk/bert-uncased-keyword-extractor`
- For summarization: `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`

## Testing Your Implementation

After making these changes:

1. Restart your development server
2. Navigate to the Industry News page
3. Check the browser console for any error messages related to the Hugging Face API
